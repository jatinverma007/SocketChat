# End-to-End Encryption - Usage Guide

## ✅ What's Implemented

### iOS Client Features:
1. **EncryptionManager** - Handles all encryption operations
2. **RSA Key Pair Generation** - Automatic on first use
3. **Keychain Storage** - Private keys stored securely
4. **Public Key Upload** - Automatic on login/signup
5. **Hybrid Encryption** - AES-256-GCM + RSA-2048
6. **Message Encryption** - Transparent to user
7. **Message Decryption** - Automatic when receiving
8. **UI Indicators** - Lock icons show encryption status

## 🚀 How It Works

### First Time Login/Signup:
```
1. User logs in or signs up
2. App generates RSA-2048 key pair
3. Private key → iOS Keychain (secure)
4. Public key → Server (accessible to others)
5. ✅ Ready for encrypted messaging!
```

### Sending Messages:
```
1. User types message
2. App checks if encryption is available
3. If yes: Encrypt → Send encrypted
4. If no: Send unencrypted (fallback)
5. Shows lock icon if encrypted
```

### Receiving Messages:
```
1. Message arrives from server
2. App checks if encrypted
3. If yes: Decrypt automatically
4. Display decrypted text
5. Shows lock icon on encrypted messages
```

## 🔒 Encryption Indicators

### In Chat Room:
- **🔒 Green Lock + "E2EE"** = End-to-end encryption enabled
- **🔓 Orange Lock** = Encryption not available

### In Messages:
- **Small lock icon** appears on encrypted messages

## 📱 User Experience

### What Users See:
1. **Login** → "🔐 Setting up end-to-end encryption..." (console)
2. **Open Chat** → Lock icon in navigation bar
3. **Send Message** → Transparent (works like normal)
4. **Receive Message** → Transparent (auto-decrypted)

### If Decryption Fails:
- Shows: `🔒 [Encrypted message - unable to decrypt]`
- Reasons: User doesn't have private key, or wrong recipient

## 🛡️ Security Features

### What's Protected:
✅ Message content encrypted end-to-end
✅ Private keys never leave device
✅ Keys stored in iOS Keychain
✅ Server never sees plaintext
✅ Forward secrecy (new key per message)

### What's NOT Encrypted:
⚠️ Message metadata (sender, timestamp, room)
⚠️ User names
⚠️ Room names
⚠️ Who's typing indicators

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Encryption Algorithm:
- **AES-256-GCM** for message content (symmetric)
- **RSA-2048-OAEP-SHA256** for key exchange (asymmetric)

### Key Storage:
- **Private Key**: iOS Keychain with `.whenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`
- **Public Key**: Server database (accessible to all users)

### Message Flow:
1. Generate random AES-256 key
2. Encrypt message with AES key
3. Encrypt AES key with each recipient's RSA public key
4. Send: `{encrypted_message, [encrypted_keys...]}`
5. Recipient decrypts AES key with their private key
6. Decrypt message with AES key

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Encryption Manually:
1. Create 2 accounts (user1, user2)
2. Both log in (keys auto-generated)
3. User1 sends message to user2
4. Check console for encryption logs:
   ```
   🔐 Encryption enabled - sending encrypted message
   🔐 Encrypting message with 2 recipient keys...
   ✅ Encrypted message sent successfully
   ```
5. User2 receives and sees decrypted message
6. Check for lock icon on message

### Console Logs to Look For:
```
✅ Key pair generated successfully
✅ Public key uploaded successfully
✅ Encryption setup complete - 2 public keys loaded
🔒 Encryption ready (2 users)
🔐 Encrypting message with 2 recipient keys...
✅ Message encrypted successfully
✅ Encrypted message sent successfully
🔐 ServerMessage: Encrypted message received, attempting decryption...
✅ ServerMessage: Message decrypted successfully
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Encryption not available"
**Problem**: No public keys found for room
**Solution**: 
- Ensure all users have logged in at least once
- Check server logs for key upload success
- Verify `/api/encryption/keys/room/{id}` returns keys

### "Unable to decrypt message"
**Problem**: Your private key doesn't match
**Solution**:
- You're not the intended recipient
- Your keys were regenerated (clear app data fixes this)
- Message was encrypted before you joined

### "Failed to upload public key"
**Problem**: Server rejected key upload
**Solution**:
- Check authentication token is valid
- Verify server encryption endpoint is running
- Check server logs for errors

## 📊 API Endpoints Used

### Auto-Called by App:
- `POST /api/encryption/keys/upload` - Upload public key (on login)
- `GET /api/encryption/keys/room/{id}` - Fetch room keys (on join room)
- `POST /api/encryption/messages/send-encrypted` - Send encrypted message

### Manual Testing:
```bash
# Upload key
curl -X POST http://172.20.10.2:8000/api/encryption/keys/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"public_key":"BASE64_KEY","key_format":"RSA-2048"}'

# Get room keys
curl http://172.20.10.2:8000/api/encryption/keys/room/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# Check encryption status
curl http://172.20.10.2:8000/api/encryption/keys/room/1/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

## 🔄 Migration from Unencrypted

### Current Behavior:
- ✅ Old messages: Show as-is (unencrypted)
- ✅ New messages: Automatically encrypted (if keys available)
- ✅ Mixed rooms: Both encrypted and unencrypted work

### Gradual Rollout:
1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Optional encryption, falls back to unencrypted
2. **Phase 2**: Show warning for unencrypted messages
3. **Phase 3**: Make encryption mandatory

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Key Verification** - Show key fingerprints for manual verification
2. **Key Rotation** - Allow users to regenerate keys
3. **Encrypted Attachments** - Extend encryption to files
4. **Local Database Encryption** - Encrypt stored messages
5. **Session Keys** - Implement forward secrecy per session
6. **Safety Numbers** - WhatsApp-style security codes
